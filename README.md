Payment Process Gateway App

Coding exercise: Write a Flask Web API with only 1 method called “ProcessPayment” that receives a request like this - CreditCardNumber (mandatory, string, it should be a valid credit card number) - CardHolder: (mandatory, string) - ExpirationDate (mandatory, DateTime, it cannot be in the past) - SecurityCode (optional, string, 3 digits) - Amount (mandatoy decimal, positive amount) The response of this method should be 1 of the followings based on - Payment is processed: 200 OK - The request is invalid: 400 bad request - Any error: 500 internal server error The payment could be processed using different payment providers (external services) called: - PremiumPaymentGateway - ExpensivePaymentGateway - CheapPaymentGateway. The payment gateway that should be used to process each payment follows the next set of business rules: a) If the amount to be paid is less than £20, use CheapPaymentGateway. b) If the amount to be paid is £21-500, use ExpensivePaymentGateway if available. Otherwise, retry only once with CheapPaymentGateway. c) If the amount is > £500, try only PremiumPaymentGateway and retry up to 3 times in case payment does not get processed. Recommendations: - The classes should be written in such way that they are easy to test. - Write as many tests as you think is enough to be certain about your solution works - Use SOLID principles. - Decouple the logic the prediction logic from the API as much as possible
